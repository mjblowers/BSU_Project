This is just a quick tutorial if you are uncomfortable with using git.

Clone the repo to your local system.

You should be on the master branch, you can check by doing 'git branch'

Checkout your own repo by doing a 'git checkout -b <name of your branch>'

Do your thing.  

Git add .
Git commit -m "<name of your branch> your message here"
Git push <name of your branch?

If someone has pushed something to the master branch, either 'git stash' changes you are working on or commit them to your branch and do a :

git checkout master
git pull
git checkout <name of your branch>
git pull origin master

resolve any merge conflicts and push them up and continue working.

When you are ready to push your changes to master and have it committed :

git push origin --set-upstream <name of your branch>
